         <p>Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, vital for good vision. This damage is
            often caused by abnormally high pressure in your eye.</p>

         <ul>
            <li><strong>Open-Angle Glaucoma:</strong> The most common form, where the eye does not drain fluid as well
               as it should.</li>
            <li><strong>Angle-Closure Glaucoma:</strong> A less common form where the iris is close to the drainage
               angle in the eye. It can cause sudden buildup of pressure in the eye.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2 id="recognizing-glaucoma">Recognizing Glaucoma</h2>
         <p>Early glaucoma has no symptoms. It's important to have regular eye exams that include measurements of your
            eye pressure. If glaucoma is recognized early, vision loss can be slowed or prevented.</p>

         <h2 id="prevention-tips">Prevention Tips</h2>
         <p>While glaucoma can't be prevented, you can help detect it early by going for regular comprehensive eye
            exams. Protecting your eyes from injuries and controlling your blood pressure can also help reduce your
            risk.</p>
